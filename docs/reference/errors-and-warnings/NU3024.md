# NuGet Warning NU3024

## Scenario 1

<pre>Package 'SamplePackage v1.0.0' from source 'http://source.com/index.json': The primary signature's timestamp certificate has an unsupported digest algorithm.</pre>

### Issue

The certificate used to timestamp the package signature has an unsupported digest algorithm.


### Solution

Ensure that the Timstamp Authority's signing certificate has one of the following digest algorithms - 
* `SHA-2-256`
* `SHA-2-384`
* `SHA-2-512`



## Scenario 2

<pre>Package 'SamplePackage v1.0.0' from source 'http://source.com/index.json': The timestamp certificate has an unsupported digest algorithm. The following algorithms are supported: SHA-2-256, SHA-2-384, SHA-2-512.</pre>

### Issue

The certificate used to timestamp the package signature has an unsupported digest algorithm.


### Solution

Request the package author to re-sign the package using the `nuget sign` command as described in [NuGet docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/create-packages/sign-a-package) using the `-Timestamper` option such that the Timestamp Authority signing certificate has one of the following digest algorithms -
* `SHA-2-256`
* `SHA-2-384`
* `SHA-2-512`
